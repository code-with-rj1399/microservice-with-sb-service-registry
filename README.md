# Service Registry (Eureka) [microservice-with-sb-service-registry]

üîó **For a complete overview of the microservices architecture and setup, please refer to the [Main README](https://github.com/code-with-rj1399/microservice-with-sb-api-gateway/blob/master/README.md).**

The **Service Registry** (powered by **Eureka**) is a critical component of the microservices architecture. It allows services to register themselves and discover other services dynamically, enabling load balancing and fault tolerance.

## How to Start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Navigate to the `Application` class.
4. Run the application.
